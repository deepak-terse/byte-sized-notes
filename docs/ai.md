# Artificial Intelligence

- AI: systems designed to perform specific tasks by mimicking aspects of human intelligence, such as pattern recognition, decision-making, and language processing.
- AGI: systems with human-level intelligence, capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across various domains.
- ASI: systems that surpass human intelligence in all aspects

LLMs: 
- AI models trained on vast datasets to understand and generate human-like text
- perform natural language processing tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering.
- Data + Architecture + Training
